## Introduction

Flush Finder provides users with a user-friendly platform to discover and review buildings and restrooms. We created this website after seeing the numerous posts on the DLSU freedom wall that were asking for the best restrooms around the campus for one to do their business. Our goal is to help our users find the cleanest and most comfortable restrooms to suit their needs

## Features

- **View Establishments:** Visitors and registered users can view establishments and reviews.
- **Registered users:** Registered users can post reviews, edit their profile information (including their picture), and be remembered for extended sessions
- **View User Profile:** Registered users can view profiles of other users
- **Reviews:** Logged-in users can create reviews with titles, bodies, ratings, restroom amenities, and photos. These reviews can be marked as helpful or unhelpful by other users. Reviews can be edited or deleted.
- **Search Establishments / Reviews:** Visitors and registered users can search establishments or reviews based on keywords.
- **Establishment Owner Response:** An additional role, "establishment owner," can respond to reviews. Credentials are already in the database and the establishment owner just needs to log in.
